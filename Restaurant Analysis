## Analysis Process
To calculate how much money the most attractive listings generated, I focused on identifying the top 10 neighborhoods and the most popular-sized properties within those neighborhoods. This was done by creating a `top_listing_identifier` column in the dataset. To estimate annual revenue, I multiplied the revenue from the last month by 12, providing a simple yet effective annualization.

## Results
This analysis aims to identify the most attractive and profitable Airbnb listings in Manhattan. The objective was to maximize annual revenue and understand customer preferences. The approach involved:
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Ensuring the accuracy of the data to produce reliable insights.
- **Creation of Key Metrics**: Including revenue, annual revenue, and occupancy rates.
- **Data Analysis**: Using pivot tables and visualizations to uncover key insights.
- **Focus Areas**: Special emphasis was placed on 1-bedroom properties and top-performing neighborhoods to refine investment recommendations.

**Findings**:
- **Top Neighborhoods**: Lower East Side, Midtown, and Upper East Side were identified as hosting some of the most lucrative listings.
- **High Revenue Listings**: Specific properties in these neighborhoods achieved the highest annual revenue, indicating their profitability and attractiveness.

These insights are invaluable for Airbnb hosts looking to optimize their property offerings and pricing strategies to increase profitability.

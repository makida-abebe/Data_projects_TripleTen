# TripleTen Data Storytelling Project - What is causing returns? 

## The Prompt

Help a client analyze the Manhattan vacation rental market. They want guidance on which property types to invest in and you wukk analyze Airbnb data for insights. Make recommendations by answering the following questions: Which neighborhoods and property sizes are most attractive for vacation rentals? and How much money did these listings generate?

## The Data

The AirBNB dataset was provided by TripleTen and includes

-	**A Raw Listings Data spreadsheet containing
- **Listing identifiers like 'listing_url', 'id', 'name', 'description', 'picture_url' and more
-	**Host information like 'host_id', 'host_name', 'host_location', 'host_listing_count' and more
-	**Neighborhood information like 'neighborhood', 'latitude', and 'longitude' and more
-	**Property information like 'accommodates', 'bedrooms', 'price', 'minimum_nights', and 'maximum_nights' and more
-	**Review information like 'number_of_reviews', 'first_review', and 'reviews_per_month'and more
-	**A Raw Calendar data spreadsheet containing
-	**'listing_id'
-	**the 'date' in the listing's calendar
-	**whether the date is 'available' for booking
-	**the 'price' listed for the day and the 'adjusted_price'
-	**the 'minimum_nights' and 'maximum_nights' for a booking made on this day


## The Process

I began with essential data cleaning before using pivot tables to analyze and identify which neighborhoods and property sizes attract the most vacation renters, using recent reviews as a metric. This part of the analysis was visualized by displaying the most reviewed neighborhoods and the distribution of property sizes within those areas.



To calculate how much money the most attractive listings generated, I focused on identifying the top 10 neighborhoods and the most popular-sized properties within those neighborhoods. This was done by creating a `top_listing_identifier` column in the dataset. To estimate annual revenue, I multiplied the revenue from the last month by 12, providing a simple yet effective annualization.

## Results
This analysis aims to identify the most attractive and profitable Airbnb listings in Manhattan. The objective was to maximize annual revenue and understand customer preferences. The approach involved:
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Ensuring the accuracy of the data to produce reliable insights.
- **Creation of Key Metrics**: Including revenue, annual revenue, and occupancy rates.
- **Data Analysis**: Using pivot tables and visualizations to uncover key insights.
- **Focus Areas**: Special emphasis was placed on 1-bedroom properties and top-performing neighborhoods to refine investment recommendations.

**Findings**:
- **Top Neighborhoods**: Lower East Side, Midtown, and Upper East Side were identified as hosting some of the most lucrative listings.
- **High Revenue Listings**: Specific properties in these neighborhoods achieved the highest annual revenue, indicating their profitability and attractiveness.

These insights are invaluable for Airbnb hosts looking to optimize their property offerings and pricing strategies to increase profitability.
